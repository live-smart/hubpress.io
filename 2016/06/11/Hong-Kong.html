<p>Hong Kong scored 5.46 points out of 7 in the 2015-2016 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum and claimed crown as world’s most competitive economy according to the IMD World Competitiveness Centre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you must be totally convinced and thinking about giving it a try if not yet, to settling down in Hong Kong. I&#8217;m not here to scare anybody but be sure to consult someone like you and me who are just small potatoes seeking to make a living working for someone else, and believes that the world is a beautiful place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hong Kong is all beautiful in the eyes of beholders standing outside of it. Friendly people, smooth traffic, convenient life. It&#8217;s no surprise you&#8217;re getting this impression while you&#8217;re traveling here. After all, you&#8217;re spending the bucks and why would anyone not smile to someone who hands him money? But seriously if you&#8217;re thinking about settling down in Hong Kong and assuming you&#8217;re not so super wealthy that you&#8217;d still have to get a job, here are some pitfalls you might need to beware of.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_taxation">Taxation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ever heard about words to describe taxation in Hong Kong such as "simple tax structure", "low tax rate"， etc.? This is true if you just think about income tax (You can compute your own <a href="http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/ese/st_comp_2016_17/stcfrm.htm">here</a>). But as soon as you add up the rental, it&#8217;s a complete different story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as you&#8217;re living in Hong Kong and assuming you don&#8217;t own any real estate here, you need to rent a place for, mostly, sleeping (for the sake of long working hours here). Rental is like a fixed tax you pay every month to the landloard. Ever used paypal to receive money? You&#8217;ll be charged a transaction fee made up of a percentage of what you receive and a fixed amount. It&#8217;s the same thing here. You pay a percentage of your income to the government each year as income tax and a fixed amount to the landlord every month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How much would that fixed expense amount to? Well if you&#8217;re not super demanding in terms of space and don&#8217;t mind sharing kitchen and toilet with others, you might get by with a single bedroom in a flat of 500~600 square feet shared by 2~3 people, which costs you around 50K~60K per month as of 2016. That is an average of 167~200 square feet per person. A bedroom in this case would typically average around 80~100 square feet in size, merely enough for a single bed and a desk. You surely wouldn&#8217;t be able to own a lot of clothings. A typical standalone flat on the Hong Kong Island side however, costs anywhere between HK$12,000~20,000 depending on size, floor, facing, and various other factors. That&#8217;s <strong>HK$144,000~240,000</strong> per year! The <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/hong-kong/wages">average monthly salary</a> in Hong Kong is around 15,000 as of 2016. As an expatriate, you&#8217;re definitely no average Hong Konger. Let&#8217;s say you rent an apartment of HK$15,000 per month and earn a whopping average of HK$45,000 per month, which is three times average. Using the <a href="http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/ese/st_comp_2016_17/stcfrm.htm">tax computer</a>, we know you have to pay HK$57,360. What remains for you after just deducing that tax and rental?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>45000*12 - 15000*12 - 57360 = 302640</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>tax rate</strong> in this case is 237360/540000 ~= <strong>44%</strong>! The less you make, the higher the tax rate due to the fixed rental expense.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mpf_offsetting_of_severance_payments_and_long_service_payments">MPF - Offsetting of Severance Payments and Long Service Payments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as you work in Hong Kong, you need to participate in MPF scheme. It&#8217;s a kind of retirement plan where you store a portion of your income each month to an account, which is only withdrawable when you retire or leave Hong Kong, whichever comes first. Along with your contribution to this account, the employer needs to contribute the same amount which also will belong to you. Sounds good?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What a lot of employees like you and me don&#8217;t know is the fact that employers are entitled to offsetting any severance and long service payments using MPF. That is, when you&#8217;re unfortunately laid off for example due to a bad time such as the financial tsunami in 2008 and your company is obliged to pay you a severance fee or long-term service fee, the company is basically able to first pay you in cash and then withdraw the employer&#8217;s contribution portion from your MPF account!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some facts here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the <strong>employer&#8217;s contribution</strong> to your MPF account is a part of your asset and belongs to you. When you&#8217;re hired, that is already taken into account as company&#8217;s cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>severance payment</strong> is a kind of compensation to you for the employer having to terminate the employment earlier than the contract terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>long service payment</strong> is a kind of compensation in addition to severance payment that rewards employees who have contributed a long time in their career to the company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we can see, all above three items should belong to the employee both legally and morally. The fact that employer is able to take away any of them is morally evil to say the least. There has been constant wars between employers and employees around this and also discussions around abolishment of such laws. But I&#8217;m not really optimistic about it because the government of Hong Kong is basically there to service the wealthy and depends on them for food. Any solution that comes up therefore would be either public-fooling or mediocre at best.</p>

<h4 id="_investment">Investment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you&#8217;re reasonably better off now after years of striving and struggling, and start to think about life after retirement? How does stock investment sound?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_stock">Stock</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at world&#8217;s markets' evaluations first:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19504323/15989695/46992e0a-30b1-11e6-9df9-33ee2f6535c8.jpg" alt="46992e0a 30b1 11e6 9df9 33ee2f6535c8.jpg"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually P/E ratio reflects how the market evaluates a stock. Higher P/E of a company basically implies more trust the investors put in the management team and more confidence they have towards future profitability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hong Kong always brags about its capabilities as a financial center and its healthy and strong legal systems. At a glance at the above data however, Hong Kong is among the bottom several in terms of average P/E of the whole market. Why? Why aren&#8217;t the investors confident about this competitive financial center? What are their concerns? What are they afraid of when buying stocks in Hong Kong?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is an unfortunately ugly truth about this market that&#8217;s not so widely known to the outsiders. Normally a company is there to make money for all investors, but a majority of the companies in Hong Kong are there to make money from (or rather, cheat money out of) small investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a company needs cash, there are several things it can do to finance itself. It can issue debts, sell assets, issue new stocks, etc. But when it comes to issuing new stocks, there are huge loopholes in Hong Kong&#8217;s market laws that would basically allow major shareholders of a company to cheat the xxxx out of smaller investors like you and me. And thus even when the company is not in need of cash, it&#8217;ll issue new stocks just for the sake of robbing the small investors. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine Bob is the major shareholder of a company called Doodle whose stocks are trading at 1 dollar/share, and Alice is one of the small investors in this company. After another year of luxurious personal life, Bob is kind of stringent in pocket money again. So he goes to the market to issue new stocks at 0.1 dollar/share, which is 90% discount! This will surely bring down the current price of the stock. But wait, wouldn&#8217;t that hurt all investors including Bob himself? Sure, but he doesn&#8217;t care as the cash that the company gets through new stock issuance will somehow flow to his own bank account for example, through trading with his private company called Evil&#8230;&#8203; Doodle will of course declare some proper usages of the cash collected, but there is no law to enforce it to do so. It might as well just tell lies on the public statement and use cash for something else. Once the cash gets into Evil, it vanishes into thin air.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an obvious loophole in the system and many have raised suggestions to fix it including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Webb_(Hong_Kong_activist)">David Webb</a>. The solutions are really simple to implement, such as limiting the amount of cash a company can collect via stock issuance, limiting the discount level, etc., but why aren&#8217;t they implemented? I have no idea. But there surely is something dark going on between <a href="http://www.sfc.hk/web/EN/index.html">HKSFC</a> and the beneficiaries of the cheating stocks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_real_estate">Real Estate</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How about real estate?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has been one of the fiercest internal conflicts of Hong Kong between rich and poor. Those who own any properties would of course want property price to go infinitely up causing those who don&#8217;t own anything to have to pay arms and legs just for a little place to stay. The government of Hong Kong unfortunately stands closer to rich than poor. It&#8217;s not hard to hear in news about government saying it&#8217;s doing its best to increase supply as an attempt to bring down property price, which is contrary to what has been done. That is, <strong>the government has been lying</strong>. Let me explain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Between 2010 and 2012, the Hong Kong government pushed through 2 additional stamp duties on trading of properties, adding significantly to the cost. One of these is called Special Stamp Duty (SSD) which basically says that sellers of the properties will have to pay extra tax if they bought them less than 3 years ago. Anyone with basic economics knowledge would know that this pushes the supply curve to the left (or up) bringing price up and demand down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19504323/16073155/308b44be-3317-11e6-9965-eba3fc8a7b99.jpg" alt="308b44be 3317 11e6 9965 eba3fc8a7b99.jpg"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has always been claimed to be an attempt to curb demand. True, but only at the cost of raising the price. It doesn&#8217;t solve the problem of demand. Those who are homeless are still gonna remain so. The only way to really solve the problem is to increase supply, not decrease. And this is something the government, or rather its biggest influencer the property developers dread to think. Rather, they&#8217;d be keen to create a market that&#8217;s more or less overheated where there is always more than enough buying power to consume new supplies. And that is indeed the case in recent years when developers push new supplies to new highs, so much so that even the overheated market start to cool down a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The government also took other measures to support heating the market such as encouraging talent import from mainland China who are gonna contribute directly to property rental market (which fuels buy/sell market) and grow into full-fledged tax payers upon graduation in 2~3 years. Even if they then leave, their tuitions / cost of living have still contributed to the GDP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you wanna invest in this market, ask yourself, are you prepared to pay the bill for someone else&#8217;s greed when the bubble busts?</p>
