<p>Hong Kong scored 5.46 points out of 7 in the 2015-2016 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum and claimed crown as world’s most competitive economy according to the IMD World Competitiveness Centre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you must be totally convinced and thinking about giving it a try if not yet, to settling down in Hong Kong. I&#8217;m not here to scare anybody but be sure to consult someone like you and me who are just small potatoes seeking to make a living working for someone else, and believes that the world is a beautiful place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hong Kong is all beautiful in the eyes of beholders standing outside of it. Friendly people, smooth traffic, convenient life. It&#8217;s no surprise you&#8217;re getting this impression while you&#8217;re traveling here. After all, you&#8217;re spending the bucks and why would anyone not smile to someone who hands him money? But seriously if you&#8217;re thinking about settling down in Hong Kong and assuming you&#8217;re not so super wealthy that you&#8217;d still have to get a job, here are some pitfalls you might need to beware of.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_taxation">Taxation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ever heard about words to describe taxation in Hong Kong such as "simple tax structure", "low tax rate"， etc.? This is true if you just think about income tax (You can compute your own <a href="http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/ese/st_comp_2016_17/stcfrm.htm">here</a>). But as soon as you add up the rental, it&#8217;s a complete different story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as you&#8217;re living in Hong Kong and assuming you don&#8217;t own any real estate here, you need to rent a place for, mostly, sleeping (for the sake of long working hours here). Rental is like a fixed tax you pay every month to the landloard. Ever used paypal to receive money? You&#8217;ll be charged a transaction fee made up of a percentage of what you receive and a fixed amount. It&#8217;s the same thing here. You pay a percentage of your income to the government each year as income tax and a fixed amount to the landlord every month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How much would that fixed expense amount to? Well if you&#8217;re not super demanding in terms of space and don&#8217;t mind sharing kitchen and toilet with others, you might get by with a single bedroom in a flat of 500~600 square feet shared by 2~3 people, which costs you around 50K~60K per month as of 2016. That is an average of 167~200 square feet per person. A bedroom in this case would typically average around 80~100 square feet in size, merely enough for a single bed and a desk. You surely wouldn&#8217;t be able to own a lot of clothings. A typical standalone flat on the Hong Kong Island side however, costs anywhere between HK$12,000~20,000 depending on size, floor, facing, and various other factors. That&#8217;s <strong>HK$144,000~240,000</strong> per year! The <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/hong-kong/wages">average monthly salary</a> in Hong Kong is around 15,000 as of 2016. As an expatriate, you&#8217;re definitely no average Hong Konger. Let&#8217;s say you rent an apartment of HK$15,000 per month and earn a whopping average of HK$45,000 per month, which is three times average. Using the <a href="http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/ese/st_comp_2016_17/stcfrm.htm">tax computer</a>, we know you have to pay HK$57,360. What remains for you after just deducing that tax and rental?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>45000*12 - 15000*12 - 57360 = 302640</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>tax rate</strong> in this case is 237360/540000 ~= <strong>44%</strong>! The less you make, the higher the tax rate due to the fixed rental expense.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mpf_offsetting_of_severance_payments_and_long_service_payments">MPF - Offsetting of Severance Payments and Long Service Payments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as you work in Hong Kong, you need to participate in MPF scheme. It&#8217;s a kind of retirement plan where you store a portion of your income each month to an account, which is only withdrawable when you retire or leave Hong Kong, whichever comes first. Along with your contribution to this account, the employer needs to contribute the same amount which also will belong to you. Sounds good?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What a lot of employees like you and me don&#8217;t know is the fact that employers are entitled to offsetting any severance and long service payments using MPF. That is, when you&#8217;re unfortunately laid off for example due to a bad time such as the financial tsunami in 2008 and your company is obliged to pay you a severance fee or long-term service fee, the company is basically able to first pay you in cash and then withdraw the employer&#8217;s contribution portion from your MPF account!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some facts here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the <strong>employer&#8217;s contribution</strong> to your MPF account is a part of your asset and belongs to you. When you&#8217;re hired, that is already taken into account as company&#8217;s cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>severance payment</strong> is a kind of compensation to you for the employer having to terminate the employment earlier than the contract terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>long service payment</strong> is a kind of compensation in addition to severance payment that rewards employees who have contributed a long time in their career to the company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we can see, all above three items should belong to the employee both legally and morally. The fact that employer is able to take away any of them is morally evil to say the least. There has been constant wars between employers and employees around this and also discussions around abolishment of such laws. But I&#8217;m not really optimistic about it because the government of Hong Kong is basically there to service the wealthy and depends on them for food. Any solution that comes up therefore would be either public-fooling or mediocre at best.</p>
