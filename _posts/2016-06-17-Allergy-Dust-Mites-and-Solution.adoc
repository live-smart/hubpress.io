Have you ever experienced symptoms of allergy such as rhinitis, nasal congestion, asthma, urticaria? I've had serious rhinitis and nasal congestion during sleep since I was born, and absolutely no idea what has gone wrong. I tried different treatments such as ephedrine nasal spray, septum reconstructomy, polypectomy, none of which really worked. I've been waking up during mid of night just to get some air before I suffocate. That is until recently after I found a solution for this, one that solves it for good.

During my research, I found that my symptoms might be related to allergy to something, but I had no idea what that was. Some further digging pointed me to dust mites.

Since I don't have sofa and carpets, a major point where dust mites can thrive should be inferrably my bed or more specifically the mattress. How can I get those tiny bugs out of my mattress? I did quite a few research on this. There are youtube videos introducing heating methods for killing dust mites, which are more or less one off and won't solve the problem over time. What I need is something repeatable and that can solve the perennial problem the sustainable way.

That leads me to vacuum based solutions. I found link:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01910SH8G/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=livesmart08-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01910SH8G&linkId=2352c1144a335df35af1b62d36ea86d3[Rainbow]

But this looks more like overkill and really requires some good space to store it. A better option is link:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SMLJPKA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=livesmart08-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00SMLJPKA&linkId=e022a1567aed7d0cfa75b89fcb880ae7[Dyson V6]. It's completely cordless and battery-based. A full charge as I tested can last around 20 minutes of working at its full capacity (strong mode). The suction power is really outstanding.

It surprises me that a clean normal looking mattress can contain such amount of powder like stuff:

And better sleep for me ever after the first campaign of removing dust mites!
