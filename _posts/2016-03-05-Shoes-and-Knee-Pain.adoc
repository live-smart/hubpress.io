Knee pain is commonly witnessed among people of all ages. Causes can vary but the most significant yet often overlooked one is shoes. How would you pick a pair of shoes that would ease or prevent knee damage / knee pain?

There are 3 major factors that contribute to the comfort level of shoes.

. Arch support
. Ankle support
. Heel Cushioning

==== Arch Support

//[quote, Lauren Hutchens, The Importance of Arch Support]
The arch is perhaps the most important structural feature of our feet, which bear 200,000 to 300,000 lbs. of weight each mile we walk. Arches absorb the brunt of the pressure our bodies thrust upon our feet with each stride. Properly supporting the arch can prevent a variety of musculoskeletal problems that can lead to inactivity and even disability.

Here's a lacing technique that would help as well:

==== Heel Cushioning

The risk of knee injury is increased by physical changes as joint cartilage that absorbs shock, becomes thinner with aging, weight gain and muscle loss. Great running shoes are designed to cushion your feet, which in turn takes stress off your knees.
