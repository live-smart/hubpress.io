:hp-alt-title: Shoes and Knee Pain


Knee pain is commonly witnessed among people of all ages. Causes can vary but the most significant yet often overlooked one is shoes. How would you pick a pair of shoes that would ease or prevent knee damage / knee pain?

There are 3 major factors that contribute to the comfort level of shoes.

. Arch support
. Ankle support
. Heel Cushioning

==== Arch Support

//[quote, Lauren Hutchens, The Importance of Arch Support]
The arch is perhaps the most important structural feature of our feet, which bear 200,000 to 300,000 lbs. of weight each mile we walk. Arches absorb the brunt of the pressure our bodies thrust upon our feet with each stride. Properly supporting the arch can prevent a variety of musculoskeletal problems that can lead to inactivity and even disability.

==== Ankle Support

It really depends on what kind of ankle you have. If yours is iffy, it would generally be safer to pick a pair of shoes that provides great ankle support.

Here's a lacing technique that would help as well:

==== Heel Cushioning

The risk of knee injury is increased by physical changes as joint cartilage that absorbs shock, becomes thinner with aging, weight gain and muscle loss. Great running shoes are designed to cushion your feet, which in turn takes stress off your knees.

==== Recommendations

When it comes to running safe and in comfort, maximalist shoes are definitely the number one option to go for. And guess who's the king of maximalists?

Introducing Hoka One One. It is a French manufacturing company that designs and markets generously soled and extremely light weight running shoes for distance runners. Noted for their light weight and maximal cushioning, Hoka running shoes are dubbed as "maximalist shoes", in contrast to minimalist shoes. In 2010, it introduced the original link:http://amzn.to/1TTW0zT[Mafate], a running shoe boasting two to three times the amount of cushioning as other running shoes on the market.

So which model would you fit into? Here I picked a list of Hokas that are best for knee protection:

With one of the thickest midsoles in the marketplace, the Bondi is in an extreme class of high-off-the-ground, oversized cushioning shoes. But it’s not just the amount of cushioning, it’s the balance of the shoe and its unique design features—specifically the rockered profile, beveled heel and significant toe spring—that make running in the Bondi 4 such an exalted experience. weights: 10.6 oz. (men’s), 9.4 oz. (women’s); heel-toe offset: 4mm; 37mm (heel), 33mm (forefoot) for men; 34mm (heel), 30mm (forefoot) for women
