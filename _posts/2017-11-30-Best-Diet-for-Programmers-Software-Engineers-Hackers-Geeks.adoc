:hp-alt-title: Best Diet for Programmers / Software Engineers / Hackers / Geeks

Are you a software developer / engineer who, like virtually any other out there has a "beer belly" to deal with? Is your career surging while your health is spiraling down? Has your doctor told you to cut calories in your diet and do more exercises?

Well, it'd probably be hard for you to squeeze 15 minutes out everyday to do exercises. Those drinking sessions are probably hard to avoid too. Is there a solid way to fix all these, flatten the belly and make the life a bit easier and healthier?

http://amzn.to/2ArVG7Q[Super Green Juice] to the rescue. Being completely organic, it's an all-in-one probiotics, antioxidants, fiber and digestive enzymes meal replacement shake which targets to alkalize, energize and detox your body. No bother with seeking and preparing ingredients yourself. They're all in there.
