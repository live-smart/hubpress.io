Are you a software developer / engineer who, like virtually any other out there has a "beer belly" to deal with? Is your career surging while your health is spiraling down? Has your doctor told you to cut calories in your diet and do more exercises?

Well, it'd probably be hard for you to squeeze 15 minutes out everyday to do exercises. Those drinking sessions are probably hard to avoid too. Is there a solid way to fix all these, flatten the belly and make the life a bit easier and healthier?

*Fiber* for example, is one of weight loss's little secrets. The main structural component of plants, fiber can't be digested by the human body. Its primary purpose is to add bulk to the contents of your stomach and digestive tract, which helps move things along and keeps you regular. As a bonus, the extra bulk in your belly helps fill you up and keep you feeling full so you can limit your calorie intake. Having a fiber-rich shake as a snack or meal replacement each day just might be what you need to shed those extra pounds. Fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, tend to be healthy and low in energy density, or calories per gram. Eating a lot of low-energy-dense foods helps fill you up on fewer calories so you can control your calorie intake to lose weight. According to a review published in "Nutrition" in March 2005, dietary fiber intake is inversely associated with body weight; people who eat more fiber tend to weigh less and have less body fat.

Replacing one meal a day with a http://amzn.to/2AVVPPY[nutritious, high-fiber shake] can help you create the calorie deficit required for weight loss. To lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, which is considered a safe and healthy rate of weight loss, you need to trim 500 to 1,000 calories from your daily diet. If you normally go out for lunch with coworkers and take in 800 calories or more, skipping the lunch outing and whipping up a fiber-rich shake in the kitchen at your office can save you 500 calories. That one change is enough to lose 4 pounds in a month.
