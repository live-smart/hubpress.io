what's up guys it's Lou from unbox
therapy and I want to share a quick
little tip here on how to modify your
browsing experience on your Android
Honeycomb tablet if you guys picked up
one of these Galaxy Tabs or even a
Motorola Xoom you probably noticed that
when you load web pages you get in the
mobile version and that ain't too pretty
on a high-resolution screen and it
really doesn't make much sense so I'm
gonna show you how to change that all
you want to do is go up to the
navigation bar here and type about colon
and then debug de bu g then click enter
and go up to this little settings bar up
here in the top right corner now my case
I had debug turned on so typing that
back in actually turned it off so I got
to go in hit enter one more time so here
we go we hit enter again
now you'll notice that this menu has
changes a couple of different options on
it that weren't there before if you
click settings
followed by debug and then you a string
which is the second option down you'll
see you have the option to change your
browser to any of these different ones
there's Android desktop iPhone iPad etc
select desktop back out of this now
you'll notice right away that when you
go and launch the same web page let's go
engadget.com
it's gonna take a little longer to load
obviously because it's the desktop
version but booyah we got the full page
and it's gonna do that by default from
now on so it's definitely a tip that
everyone should take advantage of if you
got one of these new Android tablets
anyway guys stay tuned I still got that
showdown coming up and I'm going to go
over a lot more of the intricate
features involved in this particular
tablet and others peace out
