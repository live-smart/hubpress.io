oh hello friends its unbox therapy back
in the house and today we're looking at
the EA active 2 for the PlayStation 3
and it's tough to call this thing just a
game because EA wants it to be so much
more for you they want to call it the
personal trainer in a box whether or not
it ends up being that I'll let you know
at a later date because at this point
I'm just unboxing it so here's the disc
itself pretty straightforward stuff you
see there's a picture on the front of
what I'm gonna look like when I'm
finished with the program I'm just
kidding and here's some documentation
from EA regarding how to treat your gear
this is our first sensor and this is a
special one this is the heart rate
monitor and that's important because you
can actually get some fairly
sophisticated details regarding your
workout because of this heart rate
monitor the system can tell you how many
calories you've burned can it can plot
your exercises on some different charts
and graphs so pretty sophisticated stuff
next we've got our leg sensor and this
sensor is going to give you feedback as
far as how many repetitions you've done
in a particular exercise well playing
the game or a system or whatever we're
going to end up calling it and this next
sensor is the same idea but for your arm
you wear this one on your right arm and
the heartrate monitor on your left
I have tried these on and they're super
comfortable you totally forget they're
there once they're on next we've got
some Duracell batteries to power up all
these different sensors and last we've
got a super cheap resistance band which
I probably won't end up using I will
likely replace the resistance band
exercises with weights that'll help to
increase the intensity anyways I'll come
back with a review after I've used it
for a bit so stay tuned to the channel
and thanks for watching
