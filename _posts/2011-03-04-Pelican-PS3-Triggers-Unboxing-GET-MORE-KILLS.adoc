what's up guys this is unbox therapy and
today we're taking a look at the Pelican
trigger enhancers for your PlayStation 3
what these little triggers do is clip on
to your pre-existing ps3 controller and
give you a little bit of extra grip a
little bit better functionality out of
your r2 buttons now Pelican claims that
these triggers are best suited for
driving games and first-person shooters
I've actually tried these out playing
some first-person shooters at a friend's
place and I have to admit they give you
a totally different feel and since
there's more of a lip on the trigger
your hand can rest there a little better
and subsequently be less fatigued for
you know extended periods of gaming
which I know all you like to do anyway
I'll show you how they clip on here at
first I was wondering if they would stay
because it seems crazy that a little
tiny clip would be this secure but after
snapping it on you can tell right away
that they're not going anywhere
it's an incredibly sturdy little snap
now you can see how they look and I
can't show you how they feel but I can
tell you that they're definitely worth a
try a cheap little accessory or taking a
look at anyway check out our channel if
you get a chance we got a lot more to
look at
