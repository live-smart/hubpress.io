so the next item we're looking at in the
razor boot it's called project Fiona
it's a prototype at the moment and it's
a full-featured Windows tablet so you
can you can do some serious games on
here it's actually got a core i7
processor as well as some really
intuitive looking controls but since
it's a prototype those controls might
change here you can see you've got full
triggers on the back side of that
controller it's supposed to be a
relatively high resolution screen as
well considering you're probably going
to sit close to something like this
while you're playing it at least 1366
pixels across it's obviously also going
to have a built-in battery for portable
gaming but this is not an Android tablet
so you're going to get better selection
of games as well as graphics performance
I believe there's Nvidia built in as
well but something I want to stress is
that it is a prototype right now there
is no release date and certain aspects
of the design could very well change the
control scheme might change as you can
see there's a number of buttons on each
handle that are going to be user
programmable a very exciting very
interesting new product and new way of
playing games on a portable device so
this will be cool to see how this
develops when it releases and exactly
how it performs well stay tuned for that
all right later guys
