so we're at the Nvidia booth now and
everything's about the Tegra chip of
course and it's graphics prowess here
you can see we got a J on the
transformer prime but he's also
outputting via HDMI incredible graphics
up to this flat panel right here this is
some really impressive stuff that's for
sure
definitely coming out of such a thin and
light tablet there you can see the
transformer prime hooked up to the
docking station super thin and light and
they've got a xbox360 controller
going into it yeah there you get a
better look at it just so just your
regular everyday transformer prime out
putting some serious graphics and a
proper Xbox 360 controller going into it
so you're gonna get a you know a sort of
regular console style gaming experience
on something incredibly thin and light
how you like it AJ yeah
is there any leg or anything I don't
know no ghosting there's no leg nothing
like playing
just like playing on a console so
anyways hopefully we'll get a better
look at this sometime soon guys real an
impressive stuff later
