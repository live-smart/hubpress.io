Hong Kong scored 5.46 points out of 7 on the 2015-2016 Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum and claimed crown as worldâ€™s most competitive economy according to the IMD World Competitiveness Centre.

Now you must be totally convinced and thinking about giving it a try if not yet, to settling down in Hong Kong. I'm not here to scare anybody but be sure to consult someone like you and me who are just small potatoes seeking to make a living working for someone else, and believes that the world is a beautiful place.

Hong Kong is all good from the eyes of beholders standing outside of it. Friendly people, smooth traffic, convenient life. It's no surprise you're getting this impression while you're traveling here. After all, you're spending the bucks and why would anyone not smile to someone who hands him money? But seriously if you're thinking about settling down in Hong Kong and assuming you're not so super wealthy that you'd still have to get a job, here are some pitfalls.
