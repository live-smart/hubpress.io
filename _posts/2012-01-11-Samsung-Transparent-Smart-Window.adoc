okay so right now we're looking at the
transparent smart window from Samsung
this is a transparent screen it's
ridiculous check this out
are you going to do it up here look at
this we got virtual shutters
that's ridiculous and you can you show
me real quick when you put your hand
behind this particular one so you can
see her hand they're completely
transparent yet and the video is
somewhere in between
you can see that you see those giraffes
there guys and then if you come behind
those giraffes are actually there you
see
but yeah you've still got an actual
display in between a monitor
it's truly a window that displays video
one
it's also touch sensitive is it
multi-touch
I don't know
making pharmacy
is that screen multi-touch or just
single touch single touch
Oh Twitter that's it
yeah you guys have better appreciation
of this in person it's hard to see how
try and how that transparency works but
from an angle here you get a better look
there's there's depth as if you can see
through it obviously hence the title
transparent smart window
yes
