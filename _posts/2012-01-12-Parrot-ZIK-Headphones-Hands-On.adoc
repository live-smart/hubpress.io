what's up guys we're at the parrot booth
famous from the ferry the ar.drone now
to get need the headphones you can take
a look at them they're called is sick
from parrot and the design is by start
they're real nice looking headphones
here
and they've got some real nice noise
isolation as well I just tried them on
they can also back some Bluetooth
headset you can get wireless audio
transmission through here and this side
is actually a touch sensitive control as
well
you can skip through tracks answer phone
calls etc I've been told that there's
five microphones inside of this headset
here in order to get better than oice
isolation to pick up on the vibrations
in your throat when you're taking calls
really high quality all the way around
you guys lend their finishes on the top
and as I said before great noise
isolation boosting isolation I've been
listening to a couple of tracks here and
I'm really impressed so far so no price
get no release date yet but stay tuned
to the channel I probably get a set
sooner than later alright see you guys
