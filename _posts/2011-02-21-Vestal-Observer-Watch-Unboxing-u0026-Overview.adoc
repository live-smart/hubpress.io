what's up unbox therapy here how about a
thumbs up if you enjoyed that dramatic
introduction today we're looking at a
wristwatch from Vestal the model is
called the observer and the first thing
you're gonna notice as I pull her out of
the box is how significant the size is
vessel includes the guitar pick I guess
they consider this watch to be rockstar
caliber up close the first thing we can
appreciate is the gold reflective
numbering the blackface and the white
hands making it super easy to read we
have a genuine leather strap with an
alligator style finish on it the pick
that I talked about earlier again with
the model name that I already described
here's the clasp which appears to have a
black mirror finish to it and the vessel
name imprinted there here is the backing
of the watch which is obviously done in
stainless steel we can see it has a
water resistant up to 50 meters this
particular watch has Japanese movement
inside with a 2-year warranty to boot
and as we pull off this protective
covering we're gonna really start to
appreciate that stainless steel back
this is a heavy watch it has some
serious weight on your wrist so it's not
for puny fellows if you know what I'm
saying there we saw the crown which
again is oversized here's a closer look
at the numbering and as we can see it's
going to be easily legible in broad
daylight here's how she looks mounted on
my wrist I've said in videos before I
consider myself to and have an average
to large sized wrist
but I'm thoroughly impressed with how
this feels
