in this installment of unbox therapy
we've got the dealing boxee box which
has been long awaited for many reasons
most of which you can run Boxey which
everybody loves right
anyway let's get inside this box and see
what we get for our hard-earned cash in
unusual style box let's see here this
looks like the device mm tougher then it
looks to remove keep trying we'll get
back to that let's get to the other
things first a box inside a box okay
finally something the power adapter in
HDMI cable now that's pretty nice you
don't get those from every manufacturer
our ever important paperwork and
warranty information and the remote that
everyone's been waiting for with the
unusual keyboard on the back side let's
slip it out of the plastic here there
you can see that keyboard looks pretty
good on the front we have a more
traditional remote layout that'll be
interesting to use
all right let's get to the main event
the Boxee Box itself mmm
wonder if I can get it out of this
strange secure cage it's in well that
wasn't a problem apparently you just
have to tip it here we see the unusual
shape of the Boxee Box that everybody's
been talking about let's get it out of
this plastic and get it closer to look
so here's the way it's it's sort of
off-center shape of it
this plastic away to reveal a glassy
surface on one side as we spin it around
we see not much there and here is all
the action we've got two USB ports
Ethernet port our audio ports of course
an HDMI port and on the side there we
see the SD card slot Beauty can't wait
to use it
