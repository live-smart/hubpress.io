what's up guys Lew here back with some
more cool stuff from e3 2014 we found
this glass case with some new products
from PlayStation starting from left to
right we have a new camouflage
controller we have the PlayStation TV
which I'll be talking more about in
another video we have a blue PlayStation
4 controller and then in the back we
have arguably the coolest stuff in this
case now a white edition of the
PlayStation 4 along with a magic
controller and white headset so in the
past with previous generation
Playstations they have done white
versions and just like the old school
stuff we're going to have a white
version of the PlayStation 4 to match up
with all of those classics some cool new
stuff coming along from Sony and
PlayStation and if you're in the market
for new controller maybe you want to
hold out and get something a little
cooler like this camo the blue maybe the
white and like I said before more
information about this playstation TV

that thanks for watching our coverage
