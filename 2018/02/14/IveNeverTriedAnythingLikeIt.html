<p>pop goes the weasel what doesn&#8217;t that
mean what&#8217;s going on here look at that
fancy packaging if that doesn&#8217;t pique
your interest I don&#8217;t know what would
eco-friendly types of packs kind of
fitting the shape of it the futuristic
vibe because inside is a highly
requested piece of tech started out on
Kickstarter you&#8217;ve seen in your
headphones you&#8217;ve seen over ear
headphones and this is a combination of
both some level of intelligence here
able to tune sound specifically for your
anatomical makeup that your unique
eardrums function that sounds incredibly
sophisticated and my understanding is
that it is if this is the future right
here I need to know about it and so do
you they&#8217;re called neuro the actual
headphones are called neuro phone type-c
cable lightning cable micro USB and also
an analog cable some people&#8217;s reactions
to these things were banana Wow
what we&#8217;re gonna find out if the mind is
blown ooh
the secrets a perfect sound is you how
cryptic is that Jack these are not
inexpensive they&#8217;re around 400 bucks
oh that&#8217;s a key to my heart right there
some sort of magnetic enclosure for your
uncle ooh there ooh very high caliber
experience the smell is fresh as well oh
man that&#8217;s what the inside of the ear
cup looks like excuse me that is so
bizarre that is gonna go right into your
ear canal responsible for highs and mids
and then the bass is gonna be sort of in
the surrounding region I&#8217;ve never seen a
headphone like this a lot of protective
plastic on here
okay the earcup itself is adjustable
right on the headband your connection
point is right here what you&#8217;ll see is
it&#8217;s got a proprietary connector on the
other end downside you have an issue
with this cable or you forget to bring
it with you not easily replaceable
really do update here to tell us that
these are the first headphones at least
the first we&#8217;ve seen that actually
charges from your smartphone although
there&#8217;s no indication to me that that&#8217;s
happening right now maybe we have to
install the app first do you own neuro
phones yet yes find a quiet place for
just a moment and we&#8217;ll guide you
through getting started okay
ensure the charging port is on your
right okay do tab and adjustment all
right so here we go whoa that feels very
unique oh I woke up right away she okay
she just sent hello I&#8217;m neuro phones you
will see me in two Bluetooth settings
right now this is what the app looks
like pretty basic and by default they&#8217;re
set to some kind of generic mode the
real key thing here is the
personalization of the sound signature
so what you need to do here is set up a
profile I&#8217;m ready
oh wow it looks like your neurons aren&#8217;t
creating a good seal as I adjust the
headphone it&#8217;s becoming more black I
think I got it now and this is so
futuristic
well so I feel the need to explain right
now I heard a series of beeps and bloops
and it was kind of analyzing the way I
hear thing it was able to create this
personalized setting now and what it&#8217;s
doing now is playing a sample song in
generic mode and it told me to switch
over to personalize so this should be my
reaction here wait let me turn it up
first
here we go personalize the personalized
has way more base use the outer ear
drivers to create the immersive feeling
of a live performance you have some
different settings here from gentle up
the front row let me turn this up again
oh my goodness oh my
oh my
oh when I tap the left ear cup it turns
off the personalization regardless of my
settings gentle it sounds sort of like
normal headphones all right you get up
to that front row setting oh man it lets
you know some of the most bass I&#8217;ve ever
heard on headphones in the front row
setting this is a visual representation
of my personal setting now the rumble of
the bass is serious man
is the most bass I&#8217;ve ever heard period
not even close
no close second it is so much bass if
you&#8217;re a bass head at all I mean you
have to try this this is bananas this is
like this is like a whole new device you
kind of forget that it&#8217;s headphones that
are producing it
man I don&#8217;t know how long you can listen
like that it&#8217;s a super aggressive it&#8217;s
pushing your boundaries I&#8217;ve heard some
of these songs a million times inside a
year I&#8217;m getting motivated you know you
see the basketball players they arrive
to the arena always with some headphones
on they need to get their hands on these
cuz they think they&#8217;re getting pumped up
for my goodness
you&#8217;re not gonna believe me till you try
it I mean that&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;re gonna
have to take my word for it and of
course the millions of headphones that
I&#8217;ve tested these are something
different I promise you</p>
