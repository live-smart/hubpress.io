<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s imperative for young adults and professionals to start investing early. One of the main reasons for doing so is to obtain the power of compound interest; by holding long-term investments, one can allow his or her assets to generate more returns. Investing just a few years earlier could translate into tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of additional funds for your retirement nest egg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But while it is important to invest early, it is also important to invest wisely. These five classic investing books can provide indispensable business and finance insights for young investors.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__a_href_http_amzn_to_2av1vrp_rich_dad_poor_dad_2000_a_by_robert_kiyosaki"><a href="http://amzn.to/2Av1Vrp">"Rich Dad, Poor Dad" (2000)</a> by Robert Kiyosaki</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This classic is a must-read for young investors. Kiyosaki&#8217;s view is that the poor and middle class work for money, but the rich work to learn. He stresses the importance of financial literacy, and presents financial independence as the ultimate goal, and a way to avoid the rat race of corporate America. The author points out that while accounting is important to learn, it can also be misleading. Banks label a house as an asset for the individual, but because of the required payments to keep it, it can really be a liability in terms of cash flow. Real assets add cash flow to your wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kiyosaki advocates investments that produce periodic cash flow for the investor while providing upside in terms of equity value. Real estate investments and stocks that provide dividends are viewed favorably. The author advises that America&#8217;s educational system is designed to keep people working hard for the rest of their lives, and that the school system does a poor job of teaching people to create enough wealth so they won&#8217;t have to work anymore. Kiyosaki also highlights the importance of tax planning.</p>

<h3 id="__a_href_http_amzn_to_2ayfwba_the_essays_of_warren_buffett_lessons_for_corporate_america_1997_a_by_warren_buffett"><a href="http://amzn.to/2AYFWbA">"The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons For Corporate America" (1997)</a> by Warren Buffett</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his essays, Warren Buffett—widely considered to be modern history&#8217;s most successful investor—provides his views on a variety of topics important to corporate America and shareholders. Young investors can get a glimpse of the interface between a company&#8217;s management and its shareholders, as well as the thought processes involved in enhancing a company&#8217;s enterprise value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Buffett&#8217;s essays include discussions on corporate governance, finance, investing, alternatives to common stock, mergers and acquisitions, accounting and valuation, accounting policy, and tax matters. Buffett outlines his basic business principles, and as the steward of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A
), informs the shareholders of the company that their mutual interests are aligned. He has a philosophy of bringing in talented managers at portfolio companies and leaving them alone. He advocates purchasing shares of businesses at times when these stocks are trading at a discount from their inherent value. He opposes following investing trends.</p>

<h3 id="__a_href_http_amzn_to_2au8y3c_beating_the_street_1994_a_by_peter_lynch"><a href="http://amzn.to/2Au8Y3C">"Beating the Street" (1994)</a> by Peter Lynch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Peter Lynch is one of the most successful stock market investors and hedge fund managers of the 20th century. He started out as an intern at Fidelity Investments in the mid 1960s. Nearly 11 years later, he was tasked to manage the Magellan Fund, which at the time had close to $18 million in assets. By 1990, the fund had grown to a whopping $18 billion in assets with nearly 1,000 stock positions. During this time, the fund boasted average returns of more than 29% per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Beating The Street" allows the reader to peek into Lynch&#8217;s mind and thought processes in terms of deciding whether to buy or sell a stock. Lynch believes that an individual investor could exploit market opportunities better than Wall Street, and encourages investors to invest in what they know.</p>

<h3 id="__a_href_http_amzn_to_2kwffqb_the_intelligent_investor_1949_a_by_benjamin_graham"><a href="http://amzn.to/2kWFFQb">"The Intelligent Investor" (1949)</a> by Benjamin Graham</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book was written in 1949 and has been hailed by Warren Buffett as the best investing book ever written. Benjamin Graham is considered the "father of value investing." This paradigm advocates the purchase of stocks that appear under-priced relative to their inherent value, which is determined through fundamental analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Graham delves into the history of the stock market, and informs the reader on conducting fundamental analysis on a stock. He discusses various ways of managing your portfolio including both a positive and defensive approach. He then compares the stocks of several companies to illustrate his points.</p>

<h3 id="__a_href_http_amzn_to_2yzumm1_think_and_grow_rich_1937_a_by_napoleon_hill"><a href="http://amzn.to/2yZumM1">"Think and Grow Rich" (1937)</a> by Napoleon Hill</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Think and Grow Rich" was written during the Great Depression, and has since sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. Hill conducted extensive research based on his associations with wealthy individuals during his lifetime. At the suggestion of Andrew Carnegie, Hill published 13 principles for success and personal achievement from his observations and research. These include desire, faith, specialized knowledge, organized planning, persistence and the "sixth sense." Hill also believed in brainstorming with like-minded people, whose efforts can create synergistic energy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book conveys valuable insights into the psychology of success and abundance, and should be considered a priority read given the current age&#8217;s emphasis on shock-value entertainment and negative news.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best investors did not emerge overnight, but honed their skills through years of thought, research and practice. When you are done with these books, here are several more to add to your reading list.</p>

<p><strong>Fiber</strong> for example, is one of weight loss&#8217;s little secrets. The main structural component of plants, fiber can&#8217;t be digested by the human body. Its primary purpose is to add bulk to the contents of your stomach and digestive tract, which helps move things along and keeps you regular. As a bonus, the extra bulk in your belly helps fill you up and keep you feeling full so you can limit your calorie intake. Having a fiber-rich shake as a snack or meal replacement each day just might be what you need to shed those extra pounds. Fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, tend to be healthy and low in energy density, or calories per gram. Eating a lot of low-energy-dense foods helps fill you up on fewer calories so you can control your calorie intake to lose weight. According to a review published in "Nutrition" in March 2005, dietary fiber intake is inversely associated with body weight; people who eat more fiber tend to weigh less and have less body fat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Replacing one meal a day with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2AVVPPY">nutritious, high-fiber shake</a> can help you create the calorie deficit required for weight loss. To lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, which is considered a safe and healthy rate of weight loss, you need to trim 500 to 1,000 calories from your daily diet. If you normally go out for lunch with coworkers and take in 800 calories or more, skipping the lunch outing and whipping up a fiber-rich shake in the kitchen at your office can save you 500 calories. That one change is enough to lose 4 pounds in a month.</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced symptoms of allergy such as rhinitis, nasal congestion, asthma, urticaria? I&#8217;ve had serious rhinitis and nasal congestion during sleep since I was born, and absolutely no idea what has gone wrong. I tried different treatments such as ephedrine nasal spray, septum reconstructomy, polypectomy, none of which really worked. I&#8217;ve been waking up during mid of night just to get some air before I suffocate. That is until recently after I found a solution for this, one that solves it for good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During my research, I found that my symptoms might be related to allergy to something, but I had no idea what that was. Some further digging pointed me to dust mites.</p>

<p>Since I don&#8217;t have sofa and carpets, a major point where dust mites can thrive should be inferrably my bed or more specifically the mattress. How can I get those tiny bugs out of my mattress? I did quite a few research on this. There are youtube videos introducing heating methods for killing dust mites, which are more or less one off and won&#8217;t solve the problem over time. What I need is something repeatable and that can solve the perennial problem the sustainable way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That leads me to vacuum based solutions.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knee pain is commonly witnessed among people of all ages. Causes can vary but the most significant yet often overlooked one is shoes. How would you pick a pair of shoes that would ease or prevent knee damage / knee pain?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 3 major factors that contribute to the comfort level of shoes.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Arch support</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_arch_support">Arch Support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The arch is perhaps the most important structural feature of our feet, which bear 200,000 to 300,000 lbs. of weight each mile we walk. Arches absorb the brunt of the pressure our bodies thrust upon our feet with each stride. Properly supporting the arch can prevent a variety of musculoskeletal problems that can lead to inactivity and even disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19504323/15632485/b4cd98a8-25c5-11e6-8c46-2b222e525c75.jpg" alt="b4cd98a8 25c5 11e6 8c46 2b222e525c75.jpg"></span></p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ankle_support">Ankle Support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It really depends on what kind of ankle you have. If yours is iffy, it would generally be safer to pick a pair of shoes that provides great ankle support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a lacing technique that would help as well:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_heel_cushioning">Heel Cushioning</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The risk of knee injury is increased by physical changes as joint cartilage that absorbs shock, becomes thinner with aging, weight gain and muscle loss. Great running shoes are designed to cushion your feet, which in turn takes stress off your knees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19504323/15452729/4993684a-202c-11e6-9efb-232c71ebd5c8.jpg" alt="4993684a 202c 11e6 9efb 232c71ebd5c8.jpg"></span></p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_recommendations">Recommendations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to running safe and in comfort, maximalist shoes are definitely the number one option to go for. And guess who&#8217;s the king of maximalists?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introducing Hoka One One. It is a French manufacturing company that designs and markets generously soled and extremely light weight running shoes for distance runners. Noted for their light weight and maximal cushioning, Hoka running shoes are dubbed as "maximalist shoes", in contrast to minimalist shoes. In 2010, it introduced the original <a href="http://amzn.to/1TTW0zT">Mafate</a>, a running shoe boasting two to three times the amount of cushioning as other running shoes on the market.</p>

But it’s not just the amount of cushioning, it’s the balance of the shoe and its unique design features—specifically the rockered profile, beveled heel and significant toe spring—that make running in the Bondi 4 such an exalted experience. weights: 10.6 oz. (men’s), 9.4 oz. (women’s); heel-toe offset: 4mm; 37mm (heel), 33mm (forefoot) for men; 34mm (heel), 30mm (forefoot) for women

Hoka made a few small but significant tweaks to the award-winning Clifton for 2016, most notably making it a few millimeters wider in the forefoot and replacing the overlays on the upper with a sleeker, seamless TPU-reinforced mesh. ($130, 5mm heel-toe offset, 8.6 oz.)
