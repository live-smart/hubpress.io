<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way we go about getting jobs has changed. Through technology and the networks that offer more intel on our prospective employers, we are better prepared than ever to find the right career path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The latest generation of job-seekers is also different, and not only in how it approaches the task of finding work, but in its philosophy and attitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finding the right occupation is important not just for scoring a paycheck in an expensive world, but for career happiness. You, at 22, are going to work, in all likelihood, for 50 years. Make sure you love it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_new_job_hunters">The New Job Hunters</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a fearlessness about this generation. They are risk-takers, they are willing the try something new, they are willing to punch above their weight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Younger people looking for work today also have a different outlook on failure in that they are more willing to learn from failure and do not see it as a source of shame that would forever stain their resumes. It&#8217;s generation that has come into the workforce and has been made bolder through the use of technology and information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because job seekers have more access to intel – through LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other such sites – they simply know more about companies they are contemplating working for and have the power to contact employees of those firms. Because of that the interview process has become more collaborative and much more transparent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_is_it_time_to_find_something_new">Is It Time To Find Something New?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important element in a job search process is knowing, first of all, when it’s the right time to look for a new job. That means asking yourself several questions: Do you feel like you are growing in your role? Do you have the type of relationship with your manager that you want to have? And, do you see a career path laid out before you? If you have an honest conversation in those three areas, It’s pretty easy to figure out whether you’ve hit a rough patch that you can work through, or if it is time to move on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you identify discontent in one or more of these areas, be aware that you might be able to rectify your situation by speaking with your manager or HR rep. If you do so and still feel unhappy, then you need to start the search process.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As it always has been, <a href="http://amzn.to/2o3iyVx">networking</a> is key. The difference now, of course, is that there are tools to do it. An internal referral or even a LinkedIn introduction can set you apart from the pack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Media is important for job candidates. If you are not in a confidential search, posting to your social networks that you are looking, and what you are looking for, is an important form of networking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizations still post to job sites. While <a href="http://amzn.to/2o3iyVx">LinkedIn</a>, Monster and Career Builders are still relevant, <a href="http://amzn.to/2ytviEO">Indeed.com</a> scrapes corporate web sites, so look there too. Don’t ignore, ZipRecruiter, Simply Hired and Mighty Recruiter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cold Calling is an option. If you have identified one or more organizations, that you believe offer the ideal work and environment, but they do not have a position posted, you can cold call.  Using publically available information, or your network for an introduction, you can send your resume and a cover letter requesting a call or visit to learn more about the company and to introduce yourself for future consideration.  Many businesses will make “opportunity hires” when they meet a great person and know they will have a need, but don’t have an open position quite yet</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sending_your_application">Sending Your Application</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your resume must be flawless: spelling, grammar and accuracy still matter and can be the difference between being screened for the position and being screened out of consideration. Be sure to read <a href="http://amzn.to/2AXvGOL">How to Write a KILLER LinkedIn Profile&#8230;&#8203; And 18 Mistakes to Avoid</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cover Letter is not dead, but it looks different than it used to. A brief, meaningful, unique cover letter will get attention. Recruiters want to know that you actually read the job posting and believe that you are a fit, not that you are applying based on a key word search.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_vetting_a_job_offer">Vetting A Job Offer</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you do receive a job offer, it’s important to understand the compensation and benefits packages that employers offer, such as…</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Base salary or hourly rate and the possibility for overtime pay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any bonus structure or signing bonus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuition reimbursement and professional development costs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relocation assistance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Housing, transportation, meals</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On-line salary data can be useful in determining if you have received a “market rate” offer. Sites like, Glassdoor, Salry.com and PayScales can help in your research, but because they rely on candidates reporting their salary, do tend to run about 10% higher than reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a connection with the people you will be working for and with, will affect how much you like, and how well you do in your job. In the best fits, candidates report an ease in communicating and a sense of shared vision.  If your conversations with folks at the hiring company were awkward, or understanding was difficult, this may not be the right role for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going back to your original list from preparing for a search, does this offer provide good work, with good people, in a good environment for you? Answer those questions for yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_hot_skills_and_industries">Hot Skills And Industries</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right now one of the most in-demand or beneficial skills a job applicant can have is some level of coding or understanding of software language. There’s virtually no limit to what somebody who can do some basic programming can do in the workplace because it’s not just for engineering anymore. It has invaded marketing and finance and HR—we’re all working on databases. We’ve turned into a workforce dependent upon databases, so having any kind of technical savvy there is going to enhance your career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this, you might find <a href="http://amzn.to/2o4QiBB">Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data</a> useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Engineering, as an industry, is hot. Mechanical engineering, as a job, is in high demand. The technical demands of many engineering jobs are starting to blur the lines between white and blue collar workers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another space to watch is <a href="http://amzn.to/2zcM1jn">healthcare</a>, especially as it pertains to the Baby Boomer generation. Everything from home healthcare to skilled planning to housing and even financial planning for retirees or those whose careers have slowed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_future_of_job_hunting">The Future Of Job Hunting</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Job seekers have never been as empowered as they are now, given the ease of research and the easy access to professional networks. This is leading to a reality in which they can, with a few simple clicks, apply for numerous jobs within a small timeframe. Since it’s so simple to apply for work, it’s harder to ascertain from simple applications who wants the job more. Going back eight or nine years, there was a natural hindrance to applying—you had to really want it. You had to know what you were talking about, you had to understand the job, you had to write the cover letter—there was an intentionality about applying that we’ve lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That makes life harder for recruiters, who are forced to deal with a higher volume of applicants that can, with the press of a button, hurl reams of resume and qualification data at them. So being able to <a href="http://amzn.to/2jUefHr">stand out</a> among such competition is crucial to any job seeker.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Corporate world, Sometimes, no matter how well you do your job, things don’t always work out the way you want them to. Your colleagues can mistake you for competition and bring you into situations that you never wanted to be. Here are some tips for surviving the corporate world. These may not be everything you need to know, but they’ll come in handy for dealing with your colleagues and managers.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_1_it_pays_to_be_nice">1. It pays to be nice</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not to be smart. No one likes a smart-ass. It gets you nowhere.</p>

<h3 id="_3_don_t_hire_do_business_with_friends">3. Don’t hire/do business with friends</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don’t hire employees or friends. It mostly ends badly. Hire people who believe in the vision and want to partner because it makes them feel alive to be apart of something bigger than them or us. Never forget that relationships in business should be business relationships. You may have a friend or lover at work, but the relationship will end the moment the opportunity to advance in the business is placed between you and your friend or lover. By the way, keep romance outside of the workplace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Always remember, Corporate offices are not democracies, not charities, and not therapy centers. They exist to make money, and they hired you to help them make money. That’s the deal. Keep that in mind every day, keep your emotions in check, do your job, and if you find you don’t like working there anymore, don’t complain – just keep it professional, and move on.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Offices with open floor plans have become ubiquitous in the tech industry. The idea is that eliminating physical barriers between workspaces also eliminates intellectual or interpersonal barriers to collaboration. And, of course, it’s a cost-efficient way to squeeze a lot of people into a small space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is, programmers hate open floor plans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CEO of Stack Overflow, Joel Spolsky, laid out some of the reasons programmers prefer their own space in an interview at the GeekWire technology conference. He pointed out that programming is a solitary activity, and developers don’t benefit from overhearing conversations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And in an open, noisy environment, that’s a difficult thing for many developers to do. At Spolsky’s three companies (Stack Overflow, Trello, and Fog Creek Software), programmers either work from home or have private offices with closing doors and natural light, he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook’s new eight acres of open-floor office space in Silicon Valley, on the other hand, is a good example of what Spolsky thinks companies should not do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hundreds of developers echoed that sentiment on Reddit, in a discussion thread about Spolsky’s talk. In addition to lamenting open floor plans, they also commiserated about other distractions like unnecessary meetings and another staple of tech offices: tabletop games that generate a lot of noise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on an analysis of 10,000 programming sessions recorded from 86 programmers using Eclipse and Visual Studio, and a survey of 414 programmers, we found:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A programmer takes 10-15 minutes to start editing code after resuming work from an interruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When interrupted during an edit of a method, a programmer resumed work in less than a minute only 10 percent of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A programmer is likely to get just one uninterrupted two-hour session in a day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how would you as a programmer overcome this open office craziness and save yourself from distractions? Here we have listed several useful tips we think might be helpful.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_noise_cancelling_headphone_earphone">Noise cancelling headphone / earphone</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the developers probably don&#8217;t have the luxury to work from home as of yet. If you&#8217;re stuck in an office and forced to focus in a noisy surrouding, here&#8217;s to your rescue: <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a>, a great price-performance ratio high-end noise cancelling headphone that gives you back your inner zen in the mid of insanities.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19504323/33706660-c5741c5c-db6f-11e7-8e29-0ee7dacbca3f.png" alt="33706660 c5741c5c db6f 11e7 8e29 0ee7dacbca3f.png"></a>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_quiet_corner">Quiet corner</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the open floor plan offices are big enough to allow some quiet corners, but most managers don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t have the incentive to optimize the usage of it. The result being, you often see a row of noisy followed by a row of developers, followed by a row of noisy guys and so on so forth. If you&#8217;re able to negotiate with your manager so that you can work in a quieter corner of the buzz, definitely do it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_alternative_work_schedule">Alternative work schedule</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If possible, an alternative work schedule allows you to have minimal but enough overlap with people you&#8217;ll need to work with. You then get to focus on coding when office is almost empty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_work_from_home">Work from home</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Better yet, if you can work from home, you naturally get away from the sources of noise. But be sure to communicate well with your managers so that they don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re doing nothing at home.</p>

<p><strong>Fiber</strong> for example, is one of weight loss&#8217;s little secrets. The main structural component of plants, fiber can&#8217;t be digested by the human body. Its primary purpose is to add bulk to the contents of your stomach and digestive tract, which helps move things along and keeps you regular. As a bonus, the extra bulk in your belly helps fill you up and keep you feeling full so you can limit your calorie intake. Having a fiber-rich shake as a snack or meal replacement each day just might be what you need to shed those extra pounds. Fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, tend to be healthy and low in energy density, or calories per gram. Eating a lot of low-energy-dense foods helps fill you up on fewer calories so you can control your calorie intake to lose weight. According to a review published in "Nutrition" in March 2005, dietary fiber intake is inversely associated with body weight; people who eat more fiber tend to weigh less and have less body fat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Replacing one meal a day with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2AVVPPY">nutritious, high-fiber shake</a> can help you create the calorie deficit required for weight loss. To lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, which is considered a safe and healthy rate of weight loss, you need to trim 500 to 1,000 calories from your daily diet. If you normally go out for lunch with coworkers and take in 800 calories or more, skipping the lunch outing and whipping up a fiber-rich shake in the kitchen at your office can save you 500 calories. That one change is enough to lose 4 pounds in a month.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s imperative for young adults and professionals to start investing early. One of the main reasons for doing so is to obtain the power of compound interest; by holding long-term investments, one can allow his or her assets to generate more returns. Investing just a few years earlier could translate into tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of additional funds for your retirement nest egg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But while it is important to invest early, it is also important to invest wisely. These five classic investing books can provide indispensable business and finance insights for young investors.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This classic is a must-read for young investors. Kiyosaki&#8217;s view is that the poor and middle class work for money, but the rich work to learn. He stresses the importance of financial literacy, and presents financial independence as the ultimate goal, and a way to avoid the rat race of corporate America. The author points out that while accounting is important to learn, it can also be misleading. Banks label a house as an asset for the individual, but because of the required payments to keep it, it can really be a liability in terms of cash flow. Real assets add cash flow to your wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Kiyosaki advocates investments that produce periodic cash flow for the investor while providing upside in terms of equity value. Real estate investments and stocks that provide dividends are viewed favorably. The author advises that America&#8217;s educational system is designed to keep people working hard for the rest of their lives, and that the school system does a poor job of teaching people to create enough wealth so they won&#8217;t have to work anymore. Kiyosaki also highlights the importance of tax planning.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his essays, Warren Buffett—widely considered to be modern history&#8217;s most successful investor—provides his views on a variety of topics important to corporate America and shareholders. Young investors can get a glimpse of the interface between a company&#8217;s management and its shareholders, as well as the thought processes involved in enhancing a company&#8217;s enterprise value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Buffett&#8217;s essays include discussions on corporate governance, finance, investing, alternatives to common stock, mergers and acquisitions, accounting and valuation, accounting policy, and tax matters. Buffett outlines his basic business principles, and as the steward of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-A
), informs the shareholders of the company that their mutual interests are aligned. He has a philosophy of bringing in talented managers at portfolio companies and leaving them alone. He advocates purchasing shares of businesses at times when these stocks are trading at a discount from their inherent value. He opposes following investing trends.</p>

<p>Peter Lynch is one of the most successful stock market investors and hedge fund managers of the 20th century. He started out as an intern at Fidelity Investments in the mid 1960s. Nearly 11 years later, he was tasked to manage the Magellan Fund, which at the time had close to $18 million in assets. By 1990, the fund had grown to a whopping $18 billion in assets with nearly 1,000 stock positions. During this time, the fund boasted average returns of more than 29% per year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Beating The Street" allows the reader to peek into Lynch&#8217;s mind and thought processes in terms of deciding whether to buy or sell a stock. Lynch believes that an individual investor could exploit market opportunities better than Wall Street, and encourages investors to invest in what they know.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Graham delves into the history of the stock market, and informs the reader on conducting fundamental analysis on a stock.

<p>"Think and Grow Rich" was written during the Great Depression, and has since sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. Hill conducted extensive research based on his associations with wealthy individuals during his lifetime. At the suggestion of Andrew Carnegie, Hill published 13 principles for success and personal achievement from his observations and research. These include desire, faith, specialized knowledge, organized planning, persistence and the "sixth sense." Hill also believed in brainstorming with like-minded people, whose efforts can create synergistic energy.</p>

<h3 id="_what_are_the_sony_wh_1000xm2">What are the Sony WH-1000XM2?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2016, the Trusted Reviews award for Best Headphones went to the Sony MDR-1000X, excellent wireless and noise-cancelling headphones with an intelligent set of features. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> are their successor, and they’re a little better in almost every way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The market is tougher now, and Sony faces fierce competition from the <a href="http://amzn.to/2z5oZKX">Bose QuietComfort 35 II</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2Azwhco">B&amp;W PX</a>. But the new <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> get so many things right it’s hard to fault them. They sound great, the noise cancellation is effective, and most of the features are genuinely useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re looking for an everyday pair of headphones, these are hard to beat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_design">Design</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/2nSPJLj">Sony MDR-1000X</a> had an excellent design that didn’t need fixing, so Sony has basically left it alone. That’s fine, since it meant the company could spare some resources towards expanding the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">WH-1000XM2</a> range – check out the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iZKcxl">Sony WF-1000X</a> wireless earbuds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> are more of a facelift than a makeover – there are a few minor improvements over the original, but unless you’re really looking for them you probably won’t notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They still look very smart, with the same streamlined silhouette and hardly any branding. The body is mainly plastic, with polished metal in the headband and good quality synthetic leather at the ears.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The paintjob is a little different: the beige version is now closer to champagne gold, while the black version is more gunmetal greyish blue. This adds a little visual flair, but the overall effect is no less subtle. If you want something with an executive vibe, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> will do nicely.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="http://amzn.to/2japefG"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19504323/33707661-1abce4d4-db73-11e7-9563-da24f9f08f1c.png" alt="33707661 1abce4d4 db73 11e7 9563 da24f9f08f1c.png"></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The synthetic leather on the outside of the ear cups has been swapped for a more tactile alternative. It’s less smooth to the touch – some might say it’s more plasticky – but I feel it’s thicker and tougher. I welcome this change, because the smooth finish of the original always seemed at risk of scratching. Now I feel a little less bad throwing them straight into my bag without first using the protective carry case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What hasn’t changed is the polyurethane foam stuffed into the headband and ear pads. They’re as squishy as ever, and the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> are as comfortable as their predecessors. Clamp force is just right; they hold the sides of your head but never squeeze. As before, the headband expands with satisfying clicks. The earcups can fold inwards on hinges, as well as swivel flat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The buttons have been streamlined. Power/pairing remains where it is, but noise cancelling and ambient sound adjustment have been merged into one. That makes it a little harder to press the wrong thing, which might sound minor, but there’s value in being able to just get on with your listening.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_features">Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improvements to the features list is a lot less subtle. There have been quite a lot of tweaks and additions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bluetooth has been upgraded. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> are compatible with aptX HD, a higher quality Bluetooth format that can handle hi-res audio up to 24bit/48kHz. LDAC is also included, and it can handle 24bit/96kHz, but it’s a proprietary Sony format, limited to Sony devices. The left ear has an NFC chip for quicker Bluetooth pairing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The touch-sensitive control pad on the right ear cup has been tightened up, so your inputs feel more accurate and responsive.The Quick Attention mode, where you hold your palm to the right ear to mute, remains unchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Ambient Sound feature is smarter. It still allows audio passthrough so you can be more aware of the outside world, but now it’s adaptive. The strength of noise cancellation will vary according to what you’re doing – sitting around, walking around, riding in vehicles or running for the bus.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="http://amzn.to/2japefG"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19504323/33707728-5f5b2c22-db73-11e7-9974-1a5480a98fb0.png" alt="33707728 5f5b2c22 db73 11e7 9974 1a5480a98fb0.png"></a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Optimizer feature has also been improved. It still scans the side of your head to measure how good the seal is, factoring in sunglasses or big hair and adjusting the sound accordingly, but now it uses a pressure sensor too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why? Sony says changes in atmospheric pressure can affect the way the drivers and noise-cancelling microphones work. The 1000XM2 measure the barometric pressure in your immediate surroundings, and then compensates the sound accordingly. The idea is that you should get the best noise cancellation the headphones can offer, no matter if you’re in a train or 35,000 feet in the air.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the time I had to test the Sony WH-1000XM2, I didn’t have any flights booked, so I can’t comment on the effectiveness of the pressure sensor. But the Optimizer feature definitely works, and I find myself re-calibrating the sound when I wear glasses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now tinker with the headphones with a mobile app. This lets you adjust the severity of the noise cancellation, or disable it entirely. You can also choose to prioritise connection stability over sound quality, or vice versa. That’s genuinely handy if you’re in a busy office or station and other people’s wireless signal interferes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Less useful are the virtual positioning and virtual surround modes. The first lets you move the soundstage in front or around you; the second attempts to replicate the acoustics of spaces such as ‘concert hall’ or ‘arena’. I wouldn’t bother with these as they just make the music sound worse. If you want really want to mess with your sound quality, I’d just play with the EQ settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s also the DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) processing, which claims to upscale compressed audio. This was on all the time in the previous version, but now you have the option to turn it off. I’d leave it on as it actually helps a little.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would be reasonable to assume all these features sap battery life, but there is actually more juice than ever. The original 1000X lasted up to 20 hours, but the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> goes up to 30 hours (wireless) or 40 hours (wired).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s even a quick charge feature – 10 minutes at the mains will give you 70 minutes’ play time. A few headphone manufacturers have switched over to USB-C for power, but Sony has stuck with the ubiquitous microUSB.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_performance">Performance</h3>

<p>When it comes to noise cancellation, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> are some of the best you can buy. I put them through a varied assault course including excited cafe chatter, rattling train carriages, roadworks with pneumatic drills and speakers blasting plane engine noises – the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">WH-1000XM2</a> dialled all that down to a whisper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They’re not quite as deadly silent as the <a href="http://amzn.to/2z5oZKX">Bose QuietComfort 35 II</a>, but it’s not a huge difference, and they’re more effective than the <a href="http://amzn.to/2Azwhco">B&amp;W PX</a>. I could (and did) fall asleep listening to these headphones on a train.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s not just the effective noise cancellation that impresses me – it’s the smart element that Sony has introduced. The headphone app works with the accelerometers in your phone to determine whether you’re at rest, in motion or in transit – and the levels of noise cancellation really do change accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ‘Staying’ mode, the headphones let some voices in so I could still tell if a colleagues wanted my attention. In ‘Walking’ mode, they let in more ambient noise so I could be aware of approaching traffic. As soon as I got onto a train, Transport mode kicked in and noise cancellation was dialled up to maximum. You can turn this off, but I love it.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for audio performance, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">WH-1000XM2</a> have many of the traits I admired so much about the original. They’re a hugely entertaining listen, thanks to a combination of hard-hitting dynamism, boundless energy and impressive rhythmic precision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That agility partly comes down to its impressive articulation and neutral tonal balance. No part of the frequency range feels exaggerated, and everything is nicely defined. There’s no flab to the bass, the midrange is direct and succinct, and the treble is clean, free of sibilance. It’s a very tidy presentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compared to the original MDR-1000X, I found the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">WH-1000XM2</a> to be a little clearer and more hard-hitting. But the audio components are the same, so I’m going to put this down to the fact that I was using aptX HD compatible music devices (an LG G6 and Astell &amp; Kern AK70). In wired mode, there was no discernable difference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_buy_the_a_href_http_amzn_to_2ivl8m4_sony_wh_1000xm2_a">Why buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a>?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/2iVL8m4">Sony WH-1000XM2</a> have improved on their predecessors in nearly every way. The physical design has been tweaked for the better, the audio performance is stronger, and the noise cancellation is smarter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the competition is tougher this year, but that’s not a problem for Sony. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2z5oZKX">Bose QuietComfort 35 II</a> offer more effective noise cancellation, but they’re not as musically talented. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2Azwhco">B&amp;W PX</a> are the best-sounding of the lot, but they’re not as smart or as good at noise-cancelling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sony, meanwhile, have excellent all-rounders that excel in every department.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

<p>TL;DR, here are the books that will pave your way to a becoming a successful programmer. Be sure to read them in the right order.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2AD6OPc">Inside the Machine: An Illustrated Introduction to Microprocessors and Computer Architecture</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jTiQto">Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming: 32-bit, 64-bit, SSE, and AVX</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2j3pxZf">C Programming Language</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you go through above books, you&#8217;ll be ready for a developer career in any direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of us who&#8217;re just getting started in programming often are misled into starting with reading a book on one of the programming languages, such as C. This is unfortunately terribly wrong for beginners in my opinion. It&#8217;s like for a baby to learn to walk before she can crawl.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_crawl_stage">Crawl Stage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programming language like C are called high-level languages, despite there are much higher level languages out there. During the Crawl Stage it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that you should kick off with something lower than a high-level language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A first step I would recommend is to learn how a computer works. This is nothing to do with software yet. It&#8217;s the hardware level of things, such as CPU, buses, memory that determine how software is run. Programming without knowledge at this level is like driving a car without knowing how an engine works - You wouldn&#8217;t get very far.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2AD6OPc">Inside the Machine: An Illustrated Introduction to Microprocessors and Computer Architecture</a> is exactly a book for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you are familiar with how computers work under the hood, it&#8217;s time to learn how to command them to do stuff for you. But no rush yet. You surely can command them with any programming language, but do start with Assembly, which is a machine level language that directly works with CPU, registers, memory, etc. All languages are eventually compiled to machine code, but Assembly is the lowest-level possible human readable language you can access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jTiQto">Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming: 32-bit, 64-bit, SSE, and AVX</a> would be great book on that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_walk_stage">Walk Stage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virtually no one uses Assembly language to code real world applications. It&#8217;s not as wieldy as we desire. High-level languages such as C, Java help abstract away many details and encapsulate what can be blocks or pages of code in Assembly within much more concise and human-readable code structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2j3pxZf">C Programming Language</a> is a book I would recommend even if you don&#8217;t need it in your job. It&#8217;s got a lot of what you need to know about a high-level language such as basic logic structures, arithmetic operations, function definitions, etc. You&#8217;ll find it much smoother with other languages once you grasp this one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll later write about higher-level languages and programming paradigms. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced symptoms of allergy such as rhinitis, nasal congestion, asthma, urticaria? I&#8217;ve had serious rhinitis and nasal congestion during sleep since I was born, and absolutely no idea what has gone wrong. I tried different treatments such as ephedrine nasal spray, septum reconstructomy, polypectomy, none of which really worked. I&#8217;ve been waking up during mid of night just to get some air before I suffocate. That is until recently after I found a solution for this, one that solves it for good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During my research, I found that my symptoms might be related to allergy to something, but I had no idea what that was. Some further digging pointed me to dust mites.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I don&#8217;t have sofa and carpets, a major point where dust mites can thrive should be inferrably my bed or more specifically the mattress. How can I get those tiny bugs out of my mattress? I did quite a few research on this. There are youtube videos introducing heating methods for killing dust mites, which are more or less one off and won&#8217;t solve the problem over time. What I need is something repeatable and that can solve the perennial problem the sustainable way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That leads me to vacuum based solutions. I found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01910SH8G/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=livesmart08-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01910SH8G&amp;linkId=2352c1144a335df35af1b62d36ea86d3">Rainbow</a></p>

<p>But this looks more like overkill and really requires some good space to store it.

It&#8217;s completely cordless and battery-based. A full charge as I tested can last around 20 minutes of working at its full capacity (strong mode). The suction power is really outstanding. With the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017R6ZO0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=livesmart08-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0017R6ZO0&amp;linkId=955f051110948cca65849f26d9c09ea3">mini turbine head</a> (see below) which comes with V6 Absolute model, I&#8217;m basically able to suck all dust mites, their remains, my own dead skin and dandruff out of my mattress.</p>

<p>Knee pain is commonly witnessed among people of all ages. Causes can vary but the most significant yet often overlooked one is shoes. How would you pick a pair of shoes that would ease or prevent knee damage / knee pain?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 3 major factors that contribute to the comfort level of shoes.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Arch support</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_arch_support">Arch Support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The arch is perhaps the most important structural feature of our feet, which bear 200,000 to 300,000 lbs. of weight each mile we walk. Arches absorb the brunt of the pressure our bodies thrust upon our feet with each stride. Properly supporting the arch can prevent a variety of musculoskeletal problems that can lead to inactivity and even disability.</p>

<h4 id="_ankle_support">Ankle Support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It really depends on what kind of ankle you have. If yours is iffy, it would generally be safer to pick a pair of shoes that provides great ankle support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a lacing technique that would help as well:</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_heel_cushioning">Heel Cushioning</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The risk of knee injury is increased by physical changes as joint cartilage that absorbs shock, becomes thinner with aging, weight gain and muscle loss. Great running shoes are designed to cushion your feet, which in turn takes stress off your knees.</p>

<p>When it comes to running safe and in comfort, maximalist shoes are definitely the number one option to go for. And guess who&#8217;s the king of maximalists?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introducing Hoka One One. It is a French manufacturing company that designs and markets generously soled and extremely light weight running shoes for distance runners. Noted for their light weight and maximal cushioning, Hoka running shoes are dubbed as "maximalist shoes", in contrast to minimalist shoes. In 2010, it introduced the original <a href="http://amzn.to/1TTW0zT">Mafate</a>, a running shoe boasting two to three times the amount of cushioning as other running shoes on the market.</p>

Hoka made a few small but significant tweaks to the award-winning Clifton for 2016, most notably making it a few millimeters wider in the forefoot and replacing the overlays on the upper with a sleeker, seamless TPU-reinforced mesh. ($130, 5mm heel-toe offset, 8.6 oz.)
