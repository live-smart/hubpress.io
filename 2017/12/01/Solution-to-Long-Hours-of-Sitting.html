<h5 id="_tl_dr">TL;DR</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2BozA2p" target="_blank">Executive Office Solutions Portable Adjustable Aluminum Laptop Stand</a> is our recommended solution to the problem of modern people sitting extensive amount of hours everyday.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our bodies are designed for regular movement, but many of us spend the bulk of their day sitting still instead. On average, a US adult spends nine to 10 hours each day sitting, which is so much inactivity that even a 30 or 60 minute workout can&#8217;t offset its effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Worse still, many Americans don&#8217;t fit in a workout or a long walk either, which means their bodies are virtually always in a sedentary state. It&#8217;s not that sitting is inherently dangerous. The danger is in the dose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While a brief period of sitting here and there is natural, long periods of sitting day-in and day-out can seriously impact your health and shorten your life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Investigations show that when you&#8217;ve been sitting for a long period of time and then get up, a number of molecular cascades occur. For example, within 90 seconds of standing up, the muscular and cellular systems that process blood sugar, triglycerides, and cholesterol (which are mediated by insulin) are activated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these molecular effects are activated simply by carrying your own bodyweight. These cellular mechanisms are also responsible for pushing fuel into your cells and, if done regularly, will radically decrease your risk of diabetes and obesity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, at the molecular level, your body was designed to be active and on the move all day long. When you stop moving for extended periods of time, it&#8217;s like telling your body it&#8217;s time to shut down and prepare for death.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_organ_damage">Organ Damage</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Heart</strong>: When you sit, blood flows slower and muscles burn less fat, which makes it easier for fatty acids to clog your heart. Research published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, for instance, showed that women who sit for 10 or more hours a day may have a significantly greater risk of developing heart disease than those who sit for five hours or less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pancreas</strong>: Your body&#8217;s ability to respond to insulin is affected by just one day of excess sitting, which leads your pancreas to produce increased amounts of insulin, and this may lead to diabetes. Research published in Diabetologia found that those who sat for the longest periods of time were twice as likely to have diabetes or heart disease, compared to those who sat the least. Sitting for more than eight hours a day has also been associated with a 90 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Colon Cancer</strong>: Excess sitting may increase your risk of colon, breast, and endometrial cancers. The mechanism isn&#8217;t known for certain, but it could be due to excess insulin production, which encourages cell growth, or the fact that regular movement boosts antioxidants in your body that may eliminate potentially cancer-causing free radicals. Findings presented at the 2015 Inaugural Active Working Summit also found that sitting increases:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lung cancer by 54 percent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uterine cancer by 66 percent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colon cancer by 30 percent</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another reason for this increased cancer risk is thought to be linked to weight gain and associated biochemical changes, such as alterations in hormones, metabolic dysfunction, leptin dysfunction, and inflammationâ€”all of which promote cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Digestion</strong>: Sitting down after you&#8217;ve eaten causes your abdominal contents to compress, slowing down digestion. Sluggish digestion, in turn, can lead to cramping, bloating, heartburn, and constipation, as well as dysbiosis in your gastrointestinal tract, a condition caused by microbial imbalances in your body. According to Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>"There is growing evidence that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of both intestinal and extra-intestinal disorders. Intestinal disorders include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease, while extra-intestinal disorders include allergy, asthma, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and obesity."</em></p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_brain_damage">Brain Damage</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your brain function slows when your body is sedentary for too long. Your brain will get less fresh blood and oxygen, which are needed to trigger the release of brain- and mood-enhancing chemicals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_posture_problems">Posture Problems</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strained Neck and Shoulders: It&#8217;s common to hold your neck and head forward while working at a computer or cradling a phone to your ear. This can lead to strains to your cervical vertebrae along with permanent imbalances, which can lead to neck strain, sore shoulders and back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back Problems: Sitting puts more pressure on your spine than standing, and the toll on your back health is even worse if you&#8217;re sitting hunched in front of a computer. It&#8217;s estimated that 40 percent of people with back pain have spent long hours at their computer each day. The disks in your back are meant to expand and contract as you move, which allows them to absorb blood and nutrients. When you sit, the disks are compressed and can lose flexibility over time. Sitting excessively can also increase your risk of herniated disks. Personally, after I reduced my normal 12 to 14 hours of daily sitting to under one hour, the back pain I&#8217;d struggled with for decades disappeared.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_muscle_degeneration">Muscle Degeneration</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Standing requires you to tense your abdominal muscles, which go unused when you sit, ultimately leading to weak abdominals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hip Problems: Your hips also suffer from prolonged sitting, becoming tight and limited in range of motion because they are rarely extended. In the elderly, decreased hip mobility is a leading cause of falls. Sitting also does nothing for your glutes, which may become weakened, affecting your stability and the power of your stride when walking and jumping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_leg_disorders">Leg Disorders</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Varicose Veins: Sitting leads to poor circulation in your legs, which can cause swelling in your ankles, varicose veins, and blood clots known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weak Bones: Walking, running, and engaging in other weight-bearing activities lead to stronger, denser bones. Lack of activity may cause weak bones and even osteoporosis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_too_much_sitting_can_take_years_off_your_life">Too Much Sitting Can Take Years Off Your Life</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more hours you spend sitting in a day, the shorter your lifespan may be. One study found, for instance, that reducing the average time you spend sitting down to less than three hours a day could increase your life expectancy by two years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, concluded that each hour spent watching television after the age of 25 reduces your life expectancy by nearly 22 minutes. To put this into perspective, the authors compared it to smoking â€“ each cigarette reduces your life expectancy by about 11 minutes. All in all, the researchers found that adults who spend an average of six hours in front of the TV will reduce their life expectancy by just under 5 years, compared to someone who does not watch TV. Obesity Panacea made a good point in its report on this study:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>"These sorts of theoretical studies obviously need to be taken with a large dollop of salt (just like the recent Australian study which estimated that every hour of TV viewing shortens your life by 25 minutes). The point is simply that there is a non-negligible impact of sitting/TV viewing on mortality, and given the extremely high prevalence of these behaviors at the population level, they can have noticeable impact on the lifespan of the population as a whole."</em></p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_solution">Solution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order for you to sit less, the solution is really simple:</p>
